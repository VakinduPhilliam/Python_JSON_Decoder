# Python_JSON_Decoder
The following scripts are written to demonstrate working with JSON objects using the Python ‘json’ module. ‘json’ is a JSON encoder and decoder. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), specified by RFC 7159 (which obsoletes RFC 4627) and by ECMA-404, is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax (although it is not a strict subset of JavaScript). ‘json’ exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library marshal and pickle modules. Compiled and presented by Vakindu Philliam.
